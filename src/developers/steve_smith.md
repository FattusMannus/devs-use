#Code Editor

I mainly work in Visual Studio Enterprise 2017, but I also regularly use Visual Studio Code.

#Visual Studio Extensions/AddIns

Below is a list of some of the extensions I’m using with Visual Studio 2017 (currently version 15.6.1 as of March 2018):

- EditorConfig Language Service by Mads Kristensen
- File Icons by Mads Kristensen
- File Nesting by Mads Kristensen
- Markdown Editor by Mads Kristensen
- Razor Language Services
- Roslynator 2017 by Josef Pihrt
- Web Compiler by Mads Kristensen

#Visual Studio Code Extensions

I don’t necessarily have all of these installed everywhere (I work on a home desktop, an office desktop, and a laptop), but here’s an aggregate list of my VS Code extensions:

- Angular Essentials by John Papa
- Angular Language Service by Angular
- Angular v5 Snippets by John Papa
- C# by Microsoft
- Beautify by HookyQR
- Debugger for Chrome by Microsoft
- Docker by Microsoft
- EditorConfig for VS Code by EditorConfig
- GitLens – Git supercharged by Eric Amodio
- IIS Express by Warren Buckley
- JS-CSS-HTML Formatter by lonefy
- Material Icon Theme by Philipp Keif
- Path Intellisense by Christian Kohler
- Prettier – Code Formatter by Esben Petersen
- Preview on Web Server by YuichiNukiyama
- TSLint by egamma
- Typescript Hero by Christoph Bueler (great for organizing imports in Angular apps)
- vscode-icons by Roberto Huertas
- VS Live Share (see me using it here)
- Winter is Coming Theme by John Papa

My custom user settings vary from machine to machine and whether I’m presenting or recording content, but here’s an example:

```
{
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "window.zoomLevel": 1,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Light+",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

I prefer to run with word wrap on in any given editor so that I never have to horizontally scroll. If there’s code, on a widescreen monitor, that scrolls off of the screen to the right, that’s probably a code smell. For long form text like HTML, etc., it makes sense to wrap it just like you would do in any text editor.

#Source Control

I’m a huge fan of Git and GitHub. I’m currently using GitKraken or the git command line for client-side git operations. I’m using VisualStudio.com with git for some client projects, too. My biggest complaint about using VisualStudio.com vs. GitHub is the authentication story, as I’ve had no end of problems with using Microsoft accounts to connect to VSTS.

#Screen Casting

I record online courses for Pluralsight and DevIQ and occasional screencasts on YouTube. I use TechSmith Camtasia to record and produce my screencasts and TechSmith SnagIt for screenshots.

#Laptop

I’m writing this on a Macbook Pro Retina 15″ circa 2013 (I purchased it in June 2014). It’s running 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and has 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM and an Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB graphics card. It’s still running well. I run Parallels to run Windows on it and I switch back and forth between MacOS and Windows when developing. It’s accumulated a few stickers over the years – here’s a pic from September 2018:

#Avatar

My avatar was created by Nate Lovett. I’m on the Stir Trek conference board and in 2016 we had Nate produce avatars for all of our speakers and board members. He did a great job, and if you’d like him to create one for you, contact him via twitter. I’m currently using this avatar on most of my social media and Slack channels, as well as the basis for my Weekly Dev Tips podcast logo.

David Neal (@reverentgeek) also does some great custom-drawn avatars.

#Drawing

Speaking of David Neal, he turned me on to the great Sketches Pro app for iOS. I’m using that along with an Apple Pencil and a relatively new iPad to create drawings for my blog posts, newsletters, and presentations. My drawing abilities are still pretty weak, but the app is very powerful and it’s quite pleasant to use the combination. In the past, I’d tried drawing pads for the PC, but it’s much easier to draw directly on the (portable) surface you’re working with than to draw on the desk while looking at the screen, I found.

#Podcast

My podcast, Weekly Dev Tips, is hosted by Simplecast. I use a Rode Podcaster microphone to record, with PSM 1 Shockmount and PSA1 Swivel Boom Arm. I use Audacity for both recording and editing. I try to script the shows as markdown which I edit using Visual Studio Code and then upload to Simplecast to act as the show notes. You can see my podcasting checklist here.

#Xbox

I recently started to make some time to play PUBG on the XBox One (my gamerID is ‘ardalis’ of course). The game’s a lot more fun with friends, which requires an adapter and headset/microphone. Here’s what I’m using:

Turtle Beach Headset Audio Controller Plus (my original XBox One controllers lack a headphone jack)
BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset, noise cancelling over ear headphones

#Summary
