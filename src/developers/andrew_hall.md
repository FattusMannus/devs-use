# Tools that I'm using:

Hereâ€™s a quick list of the tools I use and generally recommend for web development.

- SublimeText/Notepad - I love a simplistic IDE that doesn't have lots of things to get in the way
- Postman - Rest Client
- Putty - SSH Client
- FileZilla - SFTP Client

# Productivity Tools

- Todoist - I use this as my main todo list. I like the option to choose which tasks are to be done today, tomorrow etc as well as the option to organise tasks into projects
- Slack - Great for Asyncronous Communication and the /remind tool is useful
- iOS Reminders - I use this for mainly shared lists and have it integrated with Alexa

# Useful Browser Extensions

- Todoist - see above
- Awesome Screenshot - great for taking full length screenshots of sites.
- EditThisCookie - excellent tool for maniuplating cookies on the current site

# Things I'm currently reading:

- How to Be a Productivity Ninja - Some good tips on how to do more
- Making Time: Why Time Seems to Pass at Different Speeds and How to Control it - Interesting book on perception of time
- Wool - Post-apocalyptic fiction
